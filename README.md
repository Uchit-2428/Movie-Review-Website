# Movie Review Website

## Problem Statement

A movie review website created using MERN stack that allows users to search, filter and review a variety of movies. The website includes a user login, a search and filter feature to look for specific movies and a review feature for users to display their opinions about that particular movie. Users can also look at the reviews left by other people using the website.

## Motivation

The purpose of the movie review website is to help users determine if they want to watch a specific movie. The review should give enough details about the movie so that the user can make an informed decision, without giving away any essentials such as the plot.
